      <h1>Cube Draft Setup API</h1>
      <p>A simple API for generating randomized draft tables for a custom Magic: The Gathering cube.</p>
    </header>

    <section class="api-info">
      <h2>About the API</h2>
      <p>This API provides a lightweight interface for setting up draft sessions for 4 to 9 players. It generates
        randomized card packs based on predefined cube data and returns the full draft configuration as a JSON response.
      </p>
      <p>The API is designed to support a virtual draft environment by preparing balanced draft states
        that can be consumed by a host application.</p>
      <p><strong>Note:</strong> This service runs on a free-tier container and may experience brief delays after periods
        of inactivity. To reduce startup time, it can help to open this page shortly before beginning a draft.</p>
